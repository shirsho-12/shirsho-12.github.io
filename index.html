        Hey there! I am Shirshajit, and here I try to write articles on Artificial Intelligence.
        My current focus is
    </p>
    <h3> Reinforcement Learning, Flutter, Data Analytics </h3>
    <p>
        My other areas of interest include Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Human Computer Interaction, and Image
        Adversarial Attacks. I am also a decent
        amateur pianist who'll someday finish learning fast classical piece (everything is currently on hiatus).

Hey there! I am Shirshajit Sen Gupta. I am currently entering McGill as a Comp Sci and Biology major. In the mean time, I am working at Gaze Pte. Ltd. as a Junior Deep Learning Researcher.
While I work primarily in niche subtopics of Computer Vision (Adversarial Image Generation, Presentation Attack Detection and whatnot), I've been gravitating more and more towards Image Segmentation
and Reinforcement Learning.

<ul>
    <li>Don't have any published code.</li>
    <li>The code is buggy and requires extensive debugging.</li>
    <li>There are some mythical un-mentioned hyperparameters that prevent reported from being achieved.</li>
    <li>It takes forever to understand the cumbersome nature of the code.</li>
</ul>
 <p>
     It is for these reasons (and that COVID has caused my Saturdays to become stale) that I've decided to write short summaries of some of the papers I've read. All the months of handwritten notes will finally
     come to good use. I'll also attempt to provide easy-to-follow code for the papers I review on this site. Here goes nothing!

Hey there! I am Shirshajit, and here I try to write articles on Artificial Intelligence. My current focus is 
### Reinforcement Learning

My other areas of interest include Machine Learning, Computer Vision and Image Adversarial Attacks. I am also a decent 
amateur pianist who'll someday finish learning fast classical piece (everything is currently on hiatus). 

[comment]: <> (As a person who's been tinkering around with Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence for the past year or so &#40;and working since last February&#41;, I came across something I had to vent to the world.)

[comment]: <> (Of all the papers I've read, a great deal of them either:)

[comment]: <> (* Don't have any published code.)

[comment]: <> (* There are some mythical un-mentioned hyperparameters that prevent reported from being achieved.)

[comment]: <> (* It takes forever to understand the cumbersome nature of the code.)

[comment]: <> (It is for these reasons &#40;and that COVID has caused my Saturdays to become stale&#41; that I've decided to write short summaries of some of the papers I've read. All the months of handwritten notes will finally)

[comment]: <> (come to good use. I'll also attempt to provide easy-to-follow code for the papers I review on this site. Here goes nothing! )

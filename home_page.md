As a person who's been tinkering around with Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence for the past year or so (and working since last February), I came across something I had to vent to the world.
Of all the papers I've read, a great deal of them either:
* Don't have any published code.
* The code is buggy and requires extensive debugging.
* There are some mythical un-mentioned hyperparameters that prevent reported from being achieved.
* It takes forever to understand the cumbersome nature of the code.

It is for these reasons (and that COVID has caused my Saturdays to become stale) that I've decided to write short summaries of some of the papers I've read. All the months of handwritten notes will finally
come to good use. I'll also attempt to provide easy-to-follow code for the papers I review on this site. Here goes nothing!

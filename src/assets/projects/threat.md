# Project Content

Threat Detector is a multi-class object detection model built using a Bi-FPN (Bidirectional Feature Pyramid Network) backbone. The model was enhanced with spectral data augmentation using Fourier transforms to improve feature discrimination in low-contrast settings. Developed for CS4243 (Computer Vision), it placed first among 400 students on the final evaluation dataset. The project required significant experimentation with different architectural configurations and incorporated rigorous benchmarking to validate improvements.

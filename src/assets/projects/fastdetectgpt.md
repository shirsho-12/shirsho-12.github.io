# Project Content

FastDetectGPT++ was developed for CS6207 (Advanced NLP) as a research project focused on the detection of machine-generated text. It leverages a hybrid approach combining traditional linguistic markers with deep learning techniques to classify outputs from a wide range of LLMs. Extensive evaluations show a 1% performance improvement over existing state-of-the-art detectors. The project explores robustness to paraphrasing, diverse model architectures, and includes ablation studies for feature importance.

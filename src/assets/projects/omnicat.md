# Project Content

OmniCAT is a web-based platform designed as part of CS3216 to streamline multi-stage 3D segmentation workflows in dental labs. It supports annotation assignments across multiple users, allowing AI model inference in intermediate stages. By integrating an in-house segmentation model, the platform achieved a 10× improvement in data processing efficiency, reducing manual effort significantly. Built using Django for the backend, AWS for deployment, and a modular orchestration system for inference and task flow, OmniCAT is a powerful tool that bridges human annotation and machine prediction.

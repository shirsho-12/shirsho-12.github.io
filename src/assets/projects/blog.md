# Project Content

This ongoing blog series explores classical reinforcement learning algorithms like Q-learning, SARSA, and Monte Carlo methods. Each article is paired with interactive simulations including Blackjack, Roulette, and environments from OpenAI Gym. The goal is to make RL concepts intuitive and accessible, supported by clean visuals and code walkthroughs for each strategy. The series also includes a NEAT-based simulation of Flappy Bird to demonstrate neuroevolution.

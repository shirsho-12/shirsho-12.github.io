# Project Content

Cup of Sugar is a community-driven fundraising app that allows residents to raise money through sharing goods or offering services. It was developed during HackHolyoke 2022 and won Best Social Good Hack and Best Use of GitHub. The platform encourages mutual aid and local support while integrating Stripe for secure transactions. It also features a simple dashboard for campaign tracking and progress visualization.

Cup of Sugar is a one-stop platform that offers community members a variety of ways to fundraise: loan items they don’t use often, sell items (i.e. - handmade jewelry or buttons), offer services like rides or tutoring, or simply lend items for free in the spirit of mutual aid. Lenders/sellers can list whatever they are offering, goods or services in our main feed using the plus buttons - which asks for more information (picture, category and pricing) and puts that entry into our database. Borrowers/buyers can search for specific items as well as filter by category to find what they are looking for. Then, Borrowers/buyers can add everything that they need to their cart, add payment information, and checkout. At checkout, they are prompted to select a mutual aid of their choice that they want to contribute to. 25% of the transaction goes directly to the mutual aid, while the 75% goes to the buyer/lender’s account.

# Project Content

Winner - AI Agent Hackathon with Airia 2025

Built a multi-agent pipeline that automates resume screening by combining LLM reasoning with Retrievalâ€‘Augmented Generation (RAG). The system extracts structured data from resumes, augments evaluations with external knowledge (industry norms, candidate backgrounds, company hiring policies), summarizes candidate profiles, and produces standardized scores and rationales. These rationales are then passed onto personnel agents that simulate HR, CTO, and CEO perspectives to provide comprehensive hiring recommendations.

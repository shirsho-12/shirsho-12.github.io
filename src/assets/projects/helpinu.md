# Project Content

HelpinU is a platform that bridges the gap between individuals looking to volunteer and organizations seeking support. It was created for MHacks 15 and won the Best Social Good Hack. The app includes filters for location, type of volunteer work, and availability. It also supports event-based matching and provides messaging tools for organizers to communicate with volunteers easily.

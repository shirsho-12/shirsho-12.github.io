# Project Content

Mimosa is a mobile application built in collaboration with Duke-NUS Medical School to identify early signs of autism in toddlers aged 2–4. The app uses engaging animations and eye-tracking patterns from the front-facing camera to detect anomalies in visual attention. It features a series of games developed with Flutter that elicit natural eye movement and uses backend analytics to map these to ASD indicators. The solution has been designed for clinical utility and real-world usability, with research backing and a strong focus on animation smoothness and data quality.

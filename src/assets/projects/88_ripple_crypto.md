Impact Award - EasyA x Ripple Apex Hackathon 2025

Developed fIDent, an AI-powered credit scoring system that uses alternative data sources to assess creditworthiness in decentralized finance (DeFi). By integrating on-chain transaction histories with off-chain behavioral data, fIDent generates comprehensive credit profiles for users lacking traditional credit histories.

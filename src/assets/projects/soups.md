# Project Content

soupS is a social impact project that connects soup kitchens with potential volunteers through an accessible, user-friendly platform. Designed during MLHâ€™s Hacky Winterland 2, it won the Best Accessibility Hack award. The platform streamlines the scheduling and location matching process and ensures that volunteers are effectively distributed where most needed. Built with inclusivity in mind, it features high-contrast modes, screen reader compatibility, and simplified user flows.

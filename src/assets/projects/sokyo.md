# Project Content

Sokyo is a messaging app designed for university students to find peers in the same courses and build study groups. Created for MLH EduHacks, it won third place overall and received the Learner's Award. Sokyo implements chat functionality, profile matching, and scheduling features using a Flutter frontend and Firebase backend. Its goal is to foster collaboration and community among new university students, especially those entering large classes or unfamiliar environments.

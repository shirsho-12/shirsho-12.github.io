The OpenAI Gym is a fascinating place. The Gym makes playing with reinforcement learning models fun and interactive without having to deal with the hassle of setting up environments. While you could argue that creating your own environments is a pretty important skill, do you really want to spend a week in something like PyGame just to start a project? No? Well let's get right to it then.

According to OpenAI, _Gym is a toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms. It supports teaching agents everything from walking to playing games like Pong or Pinball._ And it is, to date, the best place to play around with RL. It is easy to use, well-documented, and very customizable. Go to  https://github.com/openai/gym/wiki/Table-of-environments for a breakdown of all they have to offer. Without further ado, let's get to work!

## Setup

To start working with the OpenAI Gym, we need two libraries:
- [**Anaconda**](www.anaconda.com/): This is an open-source Python distribution for data science and machine learning. Anaconda has its own package manager `conda`, which works alongside `pip`. The installation process is simple and https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual has easy-to-use installers.
- [**PyTorch**](https://pytorch.org/)<sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup>: This is an AI/ML library from the Facebook AI Research(FAIR) group. It is similar to NumPy in matrix manipulation, but is more optimized and allows GPU support. Just go to their website https://pytorch.org/ and select your system. CUDA is for NVidia GPUs, so if you don't have one/have an AMD GPU (like me), select the CPU option.

## Going to the Gym
Setting up the Gym and running environments is a very simple process. 

    pip install gym

That's it.

That was Part 1 of the setup. Next we need to install a few modules. Here I will be showing you the Box2D (Lunar Lander) and Atari (All Atari games) environment setups for now.

For Box2D:

    conda install swig
    pip install box2d
    pip install gym[box2d]

For Atari, there are two ways:

    pip install gym[atari]

If this throws any errors, use this instead:
    
    pip install -f https://github.com/Kojoley/atari-py/releases atari_py 

On Windows systems, you may need to install Microsoft Visual Studio Build Tools ([from here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/)).This will be the case if you see any errors involving *\atari_py\ale_interface\ale_c.dll*.


# First Steps

<a name="myfootnote1">[1]</a> While I won't be explicitly going through PyTorch for brevity, I will explain the functions I use as they come up. Some level of experience with matrices and NumPy is inevitable.

Welcome to my very first blog post. This will be the beginning of a series of posts on some
of the fundamental architectures in all of Deep Learning. This post will disseminate the now
**22-year old** paper by Yann LeCun _et al._ titled
[Gradient-Based Learning Applied to Document Recognition](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-01a.pdf).


I'll be focusing on the LeNet-5 architecture over Graph Transformer Networks(GTN), Space Displacement Neural 
Networks(SDNN) and some other things brought up in the 46-page paper because of their complexity and that LeNet-5 
outperformed these approaches. \(SDNNs are now a relic of the past).

LeNet-5 laid down the framework of today's AI landscape. It is the first paper that applied the modern Convolutional Neural Network
with gradient-based learning to a real-world application. Prior to LeNet-5, convolutional neural networks rarely had any applications. Instead,
static hand-crafted features and Support Vector Machines(SVMs) were the norm.

The Convolutional Neural Network (a.k.a ConvNet) consists primarily of convolutional filters and non-linearities. A 
convolutional filter is a n by n kernel that is applied over a receptive field (i.e. the image and its subsequent 
representations) using the Hadamard product sum through repeatedly convolving over it. Or in layman's terms, we multiply a certain 
square matrix with the numerical representation of the image (a W x H x C matrix). The filter slides over the image, 
and instead of tedious matrix multiplication, a simple lump sum of 1 to 1 multiplications is performed.

Welcome to my very first blog post. This will be the beginning of a series of posts on some
of the fundamental architectures in all of Deep Learning. This post will disseminate the now
**22-year old** paper by Yann LeCun _et al._ titled
[Gradient-Based Learning Applied to Document Recognition](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-01a.pdf).


I'll be focusing on the LeNet-5 architecture over Graph Transformer Networks(GTN), Space Displacement Neural Networks(SDNN) and some other things brought up in the 46-page paper
because of their complexity and that LeNet-5 outperformed these approaches. \(SDNNs are now a relic of the past)

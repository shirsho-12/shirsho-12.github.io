Hey there! I am Shirshajit, a junior at the National University of Singapore studying Computer Science and Mathematics with a minor in German. My main area of interest is in Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning, with me playing around with Data Science and Analytics from time to time. My work has focused around Computer Vision, and my blogs started off with articles on classical Reinforcement Learning. I am also into FinTech and Entrepreneurship.

I also do app development in Flutter. This I attribute to my summer project with NUS - Orbital. I use the framework to prototype ideas quickly for hackathons.

Outside of CS, I enjoy playing chess, table tennis, the piano, exploring Singapore, and trying new things. I also like tennis, but I'm not good by any stretch of the imagination.
